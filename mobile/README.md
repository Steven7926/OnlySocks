#Alrighty so this app uses expo which takes care of all the App stuff for you and allows you to focus on the react native side of things. 
#To install expo simply run;
   npm install expo-cli --global
#this wll install expo.

#Then to run the app, iI've been using my android device contected to my pc and running
   npm run android
#This starts expo and expo builds the app and shows it on your phone (you have to install Expo on your phone as well, it's in the play store)

#The wonderful thing about expo is if you run 
   expo build:android
#it will build an apk for you and deploy it to the expo website, where you can go and download the apk and install the app to your phone. 


#Expo also can run emulators for android, ios, and even web. 
#You can run these by running
  npm start 
#and then after it starts, follow the run commands in the terminal;
    a   #android
    i  #ios
    w  #web
   
#You will have to install the emulators though through xcode or android studio. 
```
